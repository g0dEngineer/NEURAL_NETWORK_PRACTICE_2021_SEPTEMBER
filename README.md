# Today, I managed to write a neural network from scratch/memory, about 1000 lines of java code, without ml libraries, as I have been doing for 2 years.
# Everytime I do this, [I am reminded of an example, why I had changed my name to God](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342328687_Why_I_an_atheist_legally_changed_my_name_to_God), and why I advise others to do so as well.
# The human brain is a remarkable engine :)


I NEURAL-NETWORK-SIMPLE-SEPTEMBER_2021
Simple artificial neural network written from memory/scratch by God in java.

  Author: God Bennett
  
  This particular session was coded by God in association with [Jamaica Artificial Intelligence Association](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMsWiuUBAIu/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) organized by [Matthew Stone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-stone-07428789/), and also [God's Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Sessions](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Sessions/blob/main/README.md).
  
  Why?: This is practice writing of basic neural network from memory. ([I do this at the end of each year, or sometimes every 6 months](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE), for practice of fundamentals.)

  The problem space is [X-OR inputs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate). So the model does xor input prediction.
  
  Given two numbers in [X-OR space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate), the model will try to guess the output.
  
  For:
  
  a) Input=(0,0) output should be 0
  
  b) Input=(1,0) output should be 1
  
  c) Input=(0,1) output should be 1
  
  d) Input=(1,1) output should be 0
